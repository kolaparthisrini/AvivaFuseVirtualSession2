Message contains data which is being transferred to a route. Each message has a unique identifier and it’s constructed out of a body, headers, and attachments.

Exchange is the container of a message and it is created when a message is received by a consumer during the routing process.
Exchange allows different types of interaction between systems – it can define a one-way message or a request-response message

Endpoint is a channel through which system can receive or send a message. It can refer to a web service URI, queue URI, file,
email address, etc

Component acts as an endpoint factory. To put it simply, components offer an interface to different technologies using the same 
approach and syntax. Camel already supports a lot of components in its DSLs for almost every possible technology, but it also
gives the ability for writing custom components

Processor is a simple Java interface which is used to add custom integration logic to a route. It contains a single process 
method used to preform custom business logic on a message received by a consumer
